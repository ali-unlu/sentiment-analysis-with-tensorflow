# Sentiment analysis with tensorflow

In this project we will create and train a neural network model to classify movie reviews taken from IMDB as either a positive review or a negative review. Essentially, we want to create and train a neural network model which, given a text review, will be able to predict if the overall sentiment of the review is more negative or more positive.

__Briefly, we will learn:__

- Downloading data
- Decoding tensorflow data and check some of the review content
- Applying padding technique
- RNN model building
- Model evaluation 
- Regularization tehcnique 
- Dropout technique
- Summary of the model
